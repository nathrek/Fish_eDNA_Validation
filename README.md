## DESCRIPTION ##

A WIP tool that takes in eDNA samples collected by the Mindaroo Foundation in Western Australia and calculates a trust / validation score for each BLAST database match based on external data sources for species known geographic dispersal, species DNA availability in the public record, and rate of mutation/evolution of species DNA. This project was implimented as a group for the final capstone project of our Master of Data Science at the University of Western Australia. 

Group members are:
* Nitish Rungta
* Ray Stokes
* Divya Kalidindi
* Sweta Manjaly
* Vinayak Jayananth
* Nathan Reed (me)

The project was sponsored by Philipp Bayer (pbayer@minderoo.org) who provided project guidance as well the original dataset of eDNA samples and their respective BLAST database matches.

## CODE STATUS ##

I (Nate Reed) have made a fork of the original project and am going to develop the code further to demonstrate my data science skills and assist with my job search in Los Angeles. The key improvements I want to make to the code are:

* Complete the code I developed from the original project to select the species with the highest probable match for eDNA samples where BLAST was only able to provide a genus level, not species level match. This code was 90% complete at the time the project was submitted and getting this up and running properly will add major value to the codebase as it allows previously unusable datapoints to be used
* Develop an interactive dashboard that allows end users to explore the data
* Create an interactive data story website that explains the key findings and helps users to understand what are the important, common factors to high quality, trustworthy and reliable eDNA samples and what are the factors associated with low quality / low probability matches
